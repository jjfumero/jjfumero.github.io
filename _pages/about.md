I am a research associate working as part of the Advanced Processor Technologies ([APT](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk)) Research Group at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) on Heterogeneous High-Level Languages Virtual Machines using GPUs and FPGAs.
Currently, I am working as part of the [E2Data](https://e2data.eu/) European project for bringing automatic GPU and FPGA JIT compilation and execution for Java programs. 
I am interested in combining GPGPU computing and FPGA acceleration with interpreted programming languages such as R, Ruby and Java through automatic parallelisation, compilation and transparent execution.

I did my PhD at The University of Edinburgh under the supervision on Accelerating Interpreted Programming Languages on GPUs with Just-In-Time and Runtime Optimisations.
In my PhD I extended the Graal JIT compiler and the Partial Evaluator to allow programmers to automatically execute Java, R and Ruby programs on GPUs via OpenCL.
My PhD was fully funded by [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=LABS:10::::::). 
You can see more details in my [PhD Thesis](https://jjfumero.github.io/publication/2017-08-22-PhDThesis).

Before doing the PhD, I did my degree at The University of La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain) and I developed my final project on the [accULL](https://accull.wordpress.com) compiler, the first open-source OpenACC compiler under the supervision of Dr. Ruyman Reyes and Dr. Francisco de Sande.
