I am a research associate working as part of the Advanced Processor Technologies ([APT](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk)) Research Group at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) on Heterogeneous Virtual Machines and language runtime systems for the acceleration of applications using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). I am also the lead architect of the [TornadoVM](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM) project (a Java framework for automatically running JVM applications on heterogeneous hardware).

Currently, I am collaborating with Intel to bring oneAPI into the TornadoVM framework to perform optimisations for Intel compute architectures (xPUs). 

I obtained my PhD at The University of Edinburgh on [Accelerating Interpreted Programming Languages on GPUs with Just-In-Time and Runtime Optimisations](https://jjfumero.github.io/publication/2017-08-22-PhDThesis). I extended the Graal JIT compiler and the Partial Evaluator to allow programmers to automatically execute Java, R and Ruby programs on GPUs via OpenCL. 

Before doing the PhD, I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science at The University of La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). In my Master’s project, I contributed to the development of the [accULL](https://accull.wordpress.com) compiler, the first open-source compiler’s implementation for the OpenACC standard, under the supervision of Dr Ruyman Reyes and Dr Francisco de Sande.

Additionally, I have also worked as an intern at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=LABS:10::::::) and [CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/cern-openlab), implementing compilers and evaluating parallel programming techniques for multi-core systems.
