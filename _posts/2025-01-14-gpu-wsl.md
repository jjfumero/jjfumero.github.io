This post explains how to prepare and set up Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) for GPU compute to run CUDA, OpenCL and oneAPI. In addition, it explains how to set up TornadoVM, but after installing the required SDKs and drivers, one can install any tool supported by WSL, such as PyTorch. 

## Configure WSL 

This tutorial assumes WSL is already installed. If this is not the case, on Windows 11 is as easy as running the following command in PowerShell in admin mode:

```bash
wsl --install 
```

This command installs, by default, the latest LTS version of Ubuntu. At the time of writing this post, the latest version is Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

For more details about WSL configuration and installation, follow the official documentation:  [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).


## Set-up CUDA in WSL 

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, chances are that you have already installed the NVIDIA driver for Windows PC. If not, the first step is to install (or update) the NVIDIA driver for Windows 11. The NVIDIA driver for Windows also includes support for WSL. Thus there is no need to install the NVIDIA driver within our WSL terminal. We only need the CUDA SDK.

```bash
## Update the system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade 
```

### Download and install CUDA for WSL


Use the NVIDIA documentation to obtain the latest instructions: [https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html)

The following commands install CUDA Toolkit 12.6 for WSL:


```bash
sudo apt-key del 7fa2af80

wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.3/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.3-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.3-1_amd64.deb
sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-6
```

Update `~/.bashrc` file to include the following content:

```bash
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/include
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/include
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/:$PATH
```

And open a new terminal. 
So now, CUDA is ready to run on our NVIDIA GPUs within WSL! 

### Compiling and Running CUDA Samples

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git 
$ cd cuda-samples/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
$ make

```

Note that, after this point, we can install `PyTorch` and `unsloth` and create fine tune LLM models in our system (if you have a powerful enough GPU, and plenty of VRAM!). 


## Intel Compute Runtime: Enabling OpenCL and Level Zero

Additionally, you can install the Intel Compute Runtime to get access to OpenCL and Level Zero for iGPUs, ARC GPUs and CPUs.

Go to [https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/) and download the latest release. In my case, at the time of writing this post, the latest version is [24.48.31907.7](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/tag/24.48.31907.7).


```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin/neo
cd ~/bin/neo
wget https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/releases/download/v2.2.3/intel-igc-core-2_2.2.3+18220_amd64.deb
wget https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/releases/download/v2.2.3/intel-igc-opencl-2_2.2.3+18220_amd64.deb

wget https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/download/24.48.31907.7/libigdgmm12_22.5.4_amd64.deb
```

#### Verify CheckSums: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/download/24.48.31907.7/ww48.sum
sha256sum -c ww48.sum
```

#### Install Intel Compute Runtime packages:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

#### Update link for OpenCL 

To run OpenCL, we need to do one more step for Ubuntu-based distributions:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so 
```

Ready! Let's set up TornadoVM 


## Configuring TornadoVM for WSL

### Install Python venv module

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv 
```

And set up a new Python environment as follows: 

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/bin/venv 
source ~/bin/venv/bin/activate 
```

Finally, let's configure TornadoVM:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone  git clone https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM.git tornado
cd tornado 

## Install OpenCL only 
./bin/tornadovm-installer --jdk jdk21 --backend=opencl

## Install OpenCL and PTX 
./bin/tornadovm-installer --jdk jdk21 --backend=opencl,ptx

## Install All backends:
./bin/tornadovm-installer --jdk jdk21 --backend=opencl,ptx,spirv

source setvars.sh
```

### Run tests

```bash
make tests
```

### Print devices:

```bash
tornado --devices
```


## Conclusions

By following the outlined steps, readers can successfully configure WSL, install CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs, and set up the Intel Compute Runtime for OpenCL and Level Zero support on compatible hardware. 
Furthermore, the guide has demonstrated how to install TornadoVM. Importantly, the guide has emphasized that once the necessary SDKs and drivers are in place, 
users can readily install other GPU-accelerated tools like PyTorch, opening up a vast landscape of possibilities for AI, deep learning,
and scientific computing within the convenient and flexible WSL framework. Happy coding!
